AiZynthFinder is a tool for retrosynthetic planning. The default algorithm is based on a Monte Carlo tree search that recursively breaks down a molecule to purchasable precursors. The tree search is guided by a policy that suggests possible precursors by utilizing a neural network trained on a library of known reaction templates. This setup is completely customizable as the tool
supports multiple search algorithms and expansion policies.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Linux, Windows or macOS platforms are supported - as long as the dependencies are supported on these platforms.

* You have installed [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) with python 3.9 - 3.11

The tool has been developed on a Linux platform, but the software has been tested on Windows 10 and macOS Catalina.

## Installation

### For end-users

First time, execute the following command in a console or an Anaconda prompt

    conda create "python>=3.8,<3.10" -n aizynth-env

To install, activate the environment and install the package using pypi

    conda activate aizynth-env
    python -m pip install aizynthfinder[all]

for a smaller package, without all the functionality, you can also type

    python -m pip install aizynthfinder

### For developers

First clone the repository using Git.

Then execute the following commands in the root of the repository 

    conda env create -f env-dev.yml
    conda activate aizynth-dev
    poetry install --all-extras
    
the `aizynthfinder` package is now installed in editable mode.


## Usage

The tool will install the `aizynthcli` and `aizynthapp` tools
as interfaces to the algorithm:

    aizynthcli --config config_local.yml --smiles smiles.txt
    aizynthapp --config config_local.yml


Consult the documentation [here](https://molecularai.github.io/aizynthfinder/) for more information.

To use the tool you need

    1. A stock file
    2. A trained expansion policy network
    3. A trained filter policy network (optional)
    
Such files can be downloaded from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/AiZynthFinder_a_fast_robust_and_flexible_open-source_software_for_retrosynthetic_planning/12334577) and [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_quick_policy_to_filter_reactions_based_on_feasibility_in_AI-guided_retrosynthetic_planning/13280507) or they can be downloaded automatically using

```
download_public_data my_folder
```

where ``my_folder`` is the folder that you want download to.
This will create a ``config.yml`` file that you can use with either ``aizynthcli`` or ``aizynthapp``.

## Development

### Testing

Tests uses the ``pytest`` package, and is installed by `poetry`

Run the tests using:

    pytest -v

The full command run on the CI server is available through an `invoke` command

    invoke full-tests
    
 ### Documentation generation

The documentation is generated by Sphinx from hand-written tutorials and docstrings

The HTML documentation can be generated by

    invoke build-docs
